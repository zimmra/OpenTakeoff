# Commit Message Format

When generating git commit messages, always follow the Conventional Commits specification:

## Format

```
<type>: <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

## Allowed Types
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `build` - Build system changes
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `chore` - Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert` - Reverts a previous commit

## Rules
1. **Type is required** - Always start with one of the allowed types above
2. **Subject is required** - Brief description after the colon
3. **Subject must be lowercase** - Never use uppercase in the subject line
4. **No period at end of subject** - Don't end the subject line with a period
5. **Body lines max 100 characters** - Wrap body text at 100 characters
6. **Blank line between subject and body** - Always separate with an empty line
7. **Use imperative mood** - "add feature" not "added feature"

## Examples

Good:
- `feat: add user authentication flow`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in canvas rendering`
- `chore: update dependencies to latest versions`

Bad:
- `Added new feature` - Missing type, past tense, uppercase
- `feat: Add feature.` - Uppercase, period at end
- `Updated the code` - Missing type
