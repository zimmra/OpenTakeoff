# Fix CI Failures

You are tasked with analyzing CI failure logs and fixing the issues. Follow these steps:

## Context Provided

$ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Analyze the Failure

Parse the provided CI failure information to understand:
- Which jobs failed and why
- The specific error messages and stack traces
- Whether failures are test-related, build-related, or linting issues

## Step 2: Search and Understand the Codebase

Use search tools to locate the failing code:
- Search for the failing test names or functions
- Find the source files mentioned in error messages
- Review related configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)

## Step 3: Apply Targeted Fixes

Make minimal, focused changes:
- **For test failures**: Determine if the test or implementation needs fixing
- **For type errors**: Fix type definitions or correct the code logic
- **For linting issues**: Apply formatting using the project's tools
- **For build errors**: Resolve dependency or configuration issues
- **For missing imports**: Add the necessary imports or install packages

Requirements:
- Only fix the actual CI failures, avoid unrelated changes
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Ensure changes are production-ready, not temporary hacks
- Preserve existing functionality while fixing issues

## Step 4: Commit Changes

After applying ALL fixes, use the Bash tool to:
1. Run: `git add -A` to stage all modified files
2. Run: `git commit -m "Fix CI failures: <description>"` to commit the changes
3. Include details about which CI jobs/tests were fixed in the commit message
4. Important: You MUST use the Bash tool to run these git commands to commit your changes

## Step 5: Verify Fixes Locally

Run available verification commands:
- Execute the failing tests locally to confirm they pass
- Run the project's lint command (check package.json for scripts)
- Run type checking if available
- Execute any build commands to ensure compilation succeeds

## Important Guidelines

- Focus exclusively on fixing the reported CI failures
- Maintain code quality and follow the project's established patterns
- If a fix requires significant refactoring, document why it's necessary
- When multiple solutions exist, choose the simplest one that maintains code quality
- Add clear comments only if the fix is non-obvious
